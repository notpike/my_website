||      LED Glasses are the way of the future for fashion and I will die on that  ||
||      hill!  Nah just kidding, though these glasses are a lot of fun to play    ||
||      with, I don’t honestly believe the masses would adopt this cyber wear.    ||
||      It’s fun to dream though. ;)                                              ||
||                                                                                ||
||      So...                                                                     ||
||                                                                                ||
||      These LED Glasses that use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and a Phone App     ||
||      to program custom images and animations. Good fun! More fun because this  ||
||      is a new vector to play some mean tricks on people who use the Chemion    ||
||      LED Glasses. Turns out there are no authentication check or special       ||
||      pairing sequences to connect to this device. It’s fair game for anyone    ||
||      with the Phone App to connect to and play with. It just lets anyone       ||
||      connect if it’s not actively connected. Also as far as we can tell it’s   ||
||      always sending advertising messages so you’re never truly safe from       ||
||      someone drawing silly things on your face while it’s on. :3               ||
||                                                                                ||
||      My motivation for poking at these glasses was purely for amusement. I     ||
||      wanted to see if it was possible to create something that would draw      ||
||      silly things on unsuspecting victims at mass. There are no redeeming      ||
||      qualities coming from this research except we all get to laugh a little   ||
||      and reinforce the idea that some form of multi-factor auth (Push a        ||
||      button to pair) is better than nothing. ;)                                ||
||                                                                                ||
||      *Note: Tnayuki first created a way to communicate with these glasses      ||
||      back in 2016. We didn’t discover this until we where ~90% done with       ||
||      our research. Didn’t want anyone to think we stole his work and called    ||
||      it our own. There was no detailed write up about the message format or    ||
||      anything else regarding this work. However, we did learn how the check    ||
||      sum works for the message from his software. His code that mimics the     ||
||      client and server of this device can be found here.                       ||

||     The IC’s being used to drive the glasses are the Microchip Sam D20 and     ||
||     nRF51822. We haven’t dumped the firmware of these IC’s, however we         ||
||     believe the nRF is just passing the messages directly to the D20. No       ||
||     way to prove this until we tap the chip but this is what we think after    ||
||     looking at how the messages are formatted. There’s still more to come      ||

||     To find the MAC address for this device you could use tools such as        ||
||     blue_hydra but I used HCI_Snoop via Android’s debugging feature. It’s a    ||
||     good way to capture packets being sent to the device and figure out the    ||
||     MAC of your target. Other methods for BLE packet capture include using     ||
||     an Ubertooth One or a micro:bit with btlejack. Both of these tools can     ||
||     be used to follow the hopping sequence of a Bluetooth device and record    ||
||     the data as a pcap (or pipe into wireshark) so this is an option if you    ||
||     can’t pull a pcap from one of the devices.                                 ||

||     At first glance, the last two headers, 0x000e and 0x0011 look like any     ||
||     other GATT characteristic but there’s a little more to these services.     ||
||     I tried replaying some of the data we captured from  the phone app with    ||
||     gatttool with no success.  After a quick google search of the UUID, I      ||
||     learned this was Nordic’s method of emulating UART over BLE! :D            ||
||                                                                                ||
||                                                                                ||
||     <b>== Nordic UART Service == </b>                                                 ||
||                                                                                ||
||     Nordic UART Service (NUS) is a 3rd party communication standard created    ||
||     by the fine folks at Nordic Semiconductors. The idea behind this method    ||
||     was to fit more data through BLE by emulating UART. BLE packets are        ||
||     limited on the size of the payload for each packet (20 Bytes) so NUS       ||
||     solves this by treating the connection as UART. NUS can string a large     ||
||     message together by breaking it up into multiple 20 byte messages that     ||
||     are sent through BLE packets. The start of the NUS message is programmer   ||
||     specific meaning It’s not defined by the NUS standard. Stop bytes need     ||
||     to be defined so both sides know when the message ends. Check Sum’s and    ||
||     CRC’s (methods to double check the message came in clear) can also be      ||
||     implemented outside of the NUS standard. Below are the UUIDs for NUS.      ||
||                                                                                ||
||                                                                                ||
||     -> Nordic UART Service (UUID: 6E400001-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E)        ||
||     -> RX Characteristic   (UUID: 6E400002-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E)        ||
||     -> TX Characteristic   (UUID: 6E400003-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E)        ||
||                                                                                ||
||                                                                                ||
||     So whose TX and RX are we talking about here? UART can be a little         ||
||     tricky but when you look at this you should always tell yourself,          ||
||     “This is the GATT server’s RX and TX, I need to send data to its RX        ||
||     and listen from its TX”. Again, data is sent to the device’s RX            ||
||     characteristic (Header 0x0011) and the GATT server ACK’s the received      ||
||     messages on its TX characteristic (Header 0x00e). Nordic’s SoftDevice      ||
||     (Vendor’s software framework for the nRF5) handles a lot of the flow       ||
||     control and error correction for the BLE packets which makes it easier     ||
||     for developers to build the thing.                                         ||
||                                                                                ||
||     Another good thing to know about NUS is that the raw data after the GATT   ||
||     header 0x0011 (0x1100 when it’s Little Endian BTW) is Big Endian! The      ||
||     rest of the BLE packet is still Little Endian which is interesting,        ||
||     however it’s good to remember that UART handles incoming data 1 byte at    ||
||     time as a stream and not a packet. This was learned by playing around      ||
||     with the nRF UART app and looking at the raw data being sent from it.      ||
||     Below is an example of a NUS message containing the value                  ||
||     “abcdefghijklmnopqrs”.                                                     ||
||                                                                                ||
||     IMG: <a href="../img/NUS_BE.png" target="_blank">NUS Example</a>                                                           ||

||     Nordic offers a lot of support for their products and it’s nice that       ||
||     most of their software is open source. It makes reversing this device all  ||
||     the less painful. Nordic also offers a wide selection of dev tools         ||
||     including a Phone app called “nRF UART” that will act as a NUS client.     ||
||     This is a useful tool for trouble shooting NUS Servers, however it wasn’t  ||
||     built for stringing together large messages. You’re only limited to        ||
||     sending 20 bytes at a time. To make a working Proof of Concept (POC) we    ||
||     had to create something of our own outside of the available dev tools.     ||
||                                                                                ||

||     NUS was new for me, so I felt it was important to have a better            ||
||     understanding of it before moving on. It’s good to learn through           ||
||     experimentation but it’s still nice to have a working example to           ||
||     reference when things don’t work. Because of this I picked up a few nRF5   ||
||     Dev Kits to hack on and see how the bits make it from one side of the      ||
||     room to the other. Even though we figured out a solution without the       ||
||     nRF5 platform, It’s still not a bad idea to work with the original         ||
||     device. It’s tricky when you’re trying to troubleshoot two unknowns at     ||
||     the same time. I spent the cash to save my sanity. ;)                      ||

||     Armed with a better understanding of how NUS works, the method for         ||
||     discovering how the message is formatted is no different than reversing    ||
||     any other unknown format. Basically, you send a command, record what was   ||
||     sent, send a different command, and then see how it’s different from the   ||
||     last. It’s that easy! Just rinse and repeat until you figure something     ||
||     out. This was accomplished by turning on and off the LED’s from the phone  ||
||     app in a uniformed order. I Started at 0x0 and worked my way down to Nx8   ||
||     going left to right, top to bottom. THANKFULLY!!! (big thankfully) the     ||
||     pattern was discovered after the first row. I did not want to record all   ||
||     210 possibilities… That’s a lot of work and you start losing it if you do  ||
||     it too long… >_<                                                           ||

||     The method for finding the check sum comes from the LED matrix portion of  ||

||     then XORing each Byte on top of the last from the LED matrix. Below is an  ||

||     I didn’t spend too much time reversing the values that were being passed,  ||
||     however you can see that it sends two messages to start the save process,  ||
||     sends the LED matrix data for the next four, then one more to close the    ||
||     save message. We tried implementing this for the POC with no success,      ||
||     kept on soft bricking it which was still fun. :3                           ||

||     We played around with a lot of different programming languages and         ||
||     hardware platforms before we settled with the ESP32 on the M5Stack. The    ||
||     M5Stack is a nice platform to experiment with because the IO is built      ||
||     into the device and there’s a good community built around it. Making our   ||
||     life easier there were even NUS Server/Client examples available from the  ||
||     Arduino library for the ESP32. Ultimately building the POC from scratch    ||

||                                                                                ||
||     The original motivation for poking this device was for piratical jokes at  ||
||     conventions and raves. It was already known that anyone can change the     ||
||     display on an unsuspecting person using the phone app. We figured if we    ||
||     could streamline the process we could have a little more fun with it. Now  ||
||     that we have a working POC, the next step would be to create an            ||
||     application that would update the glasses outside of the phone app. This   ||
||     is an ongoing project with a lot more to come so hopefully, there will be  ||
||     an update soon! If you’re interested in contributing please don’t hesitate ||
||     to make a pull request. Again, I can’t express enough gratitude to those   ||
||     who started this project before us and contributed their time and energy   ||
||     so we could reach this point! :D                                           ||
