||     Hi again!                                                                  ||
||                                                                                ||
||     I'm not a big fan of writing blogs so I figure shearing my notes on        ||
||     what I've been working on be a good compromise. Below is the story of      ||
||     the first cool thing I've done with a radio. :3                            ||
||                                                                                ||
||     When I used to go to bars, I always thought to myself how neat it would    ||
||     be to just play music from the Jukebox for free. You know? like 'The Fonz' ||
||     from the 70's sitcom 'Happy Days'? My target was an IOT jukebox made by    ||
||     TouchTunes®️ and they where popular in the Seattle area. After reading up   ||
||     on some of their manuals, I learned that they used a wireless remote that  ||
||     TXed on 433.92MHz. Promotional credits where another feature I found that  ||
||     could be exploited with the remote. Armed with that knologe, I bought      ||
||     myself a remote from eBay for about $40.                                   ||
||                                                                                ||
||     Having never done this before, I Youtubed everything I could on reversing  ||
||     wireless protocols. I realy owe thanks for the foaks at Hak5 and Michael   ||
||     Osman from GSG for spending the time to create detailed videos on the      ||
||     the topic. Using a HackRF and the program inspectrum I was able to learn   ||
||     enough about the wireless remote to program a Yard Stick One to stream     ||
||     line the process. The next step was to the record all the messages and     ||
||     compare them with each other.                                              ||
||                                                                                ||
||     TL;DR, when I first looked at this protocol, I only knew the modulation    ||
||     type (ASK/OOK), the symbol rate (1766), preamble (0xFFFF00), and the       ||
||     encoded sync word. Not knowing what the encoding method was I recorded     ||
||     every possable message from pin 000 to 255, created three ugly look up     ||
||     tables, and used a little Python hackery to make it work! And it did!      ||
||                                                                                ||
||     About a year later, a VERRY talented person (Furrtek) ported my work       ||
||     over to his portapack firmware fork, Havoc. I didn't figure this out       ||
||     untill I updated my portapack with his firmware. TBH I was a bit tickled   ||
||     to see a TX option for TouchTunes®️ at the bottom. definitely a feel good   ||
||     moment! :D                                                                 ||
||                                                                                ||
||     So not only did he port my work, he also figured out the encoding schema   ||
||     from my hacked together code. It turned out to be NEC which is an IR       ||
||     protocol used for TV remotes. NEC is simple, 1's are encoded to (1 0 0 0)  ||
||     which for OOK is (ON OFF OFF OFF) per the symbol rate and 0's are just     ||
||     (1 0) or (ON OFF). NEC isn't something wireless engineers go out of their  ||
||     way to use for a fire and forget application but there it was. :D          ||
||                                                                                ||
||     With a better understanding of how the TouchTunes®️ remotes worked, I       ||
||     updated my code to encode and decode the NEC protocol. I also added a few  ||
||     other 'features' such as a brute forcing method where it runs a command    ||
||     from pin 000 to 255 and an Electronic Warfare (EW) mode. EW is DOD speak   ||
||     for jamming when you want to jam and not jamming when you don't want to    ||
||     jam... Clear as mud? If not read the sorce code because it's unlawful AF!  ||
||     Only use EW mode for testing and in a closed RF environment!               ||
||                                                                                ||

||     SO! if you're interested in poking some jukeboxs feel free and check out   ||
||     'The-Fonz' project for the Yard Stick One. Furrtek also ported this over   ||
||     to the portapack with the Havor firmware. Also, I wrote an app for the     ||
||     goodwatch project so this research is now supported on three platforms!    ||
