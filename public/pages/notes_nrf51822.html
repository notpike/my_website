||     <b>== INTRO ==</b>                                                                 ||

||     Picking up from where we last left the Chemion LED Glasses I wanted to      ||
||     see if it was possible to dump the firmware off of one of the IC’s. The     ||
||     first IC we’re going to poke at is a Nordic nRF51822 System On a Chip       ||
||     (SoC). The tools needed for this task included a computer capable of        ||
||     running GNU Debugger (gdb) and a debugging preferential to interface with   ||
||     the IC. Be sure you have gdb-arm-none-eabi installed for this as well.      ||
||     For this write up I’ll be using Linux as my OS and a STM32 “Blue Pill”      ||
||     flashed with Blackmagic Probe to dump the bin.                              ||
||                                                                                 ||

||     The Nordic nRF51822 System On a Chip (SoC) is 2.4GHz Gaussian               ||
||     Frequency-Shift Keying (GFSK) radio built on-top of a 32-bit ARM Cortex     ||
||     M0 processor. This chip was built to be an all in one system (hence the     ||
||     acronym SoC) to drive hardware applications while being a fully capable     ||
||     BLE transceiver. In the case of the Chemion LED Glassess, it appears only   ||
||     to be a dedicated BLE device sending data to and from the Microchip Sam     ||
||     D20. I still need to figure out if that’s the case or not but that’s my     ||
||     current assumption. :3                                                      ||
||                                                                                 ||

||     Nordic chips can be interfaced via a Serial Wire Debug (SWD) port which     ||
||     is a stripped down version of JTAG. This tech, also refereed to as a        ||
||     “2-Pin Debug Port” which replaces the normal 5 pin JTAG port with a single  ||
||     bi-directional data pin (SWDIO) and a clock pin (SWCLK). The spirit of SWD  ||
||     was to cut down on costs and the amount of pins needed for hardware devs    ||
||     to debug an application. Fun fact! SWDIO uses the ARM bi-directional wire   ||
||     protocol defined in the ARM Debug Interface v5! Just in case you wanted     ||
||     some late night reading about SWD here’s a site where you can learn more    ||
||     about this. ;)                                                              ||
||                                                                                 ||

||                                                                                 ||
||     There’s also a known security flaw with the nRF51822s where it is possible  ||
||     to bypass the Code Readout Protection (CRP). This means even if you set     ||
||     the CRP to true, you can still dump the code memory provided if you have    ||
||     physical access to the device. This flaw originates from the Cortext-M0     ||
||     processor so any IC that uses this ARM processor as it’s foundation may be  ||
||     vulnerable. The CRP protections for the target described in this write up   ||
||     where set to false so this bypass wasn’t needed however I’ll briefly cover  ||
||     it in this write up. If you would like to know more about this              ||
||     vulnerability the white paper and POC can be found here.                    ||

||     <b>== Blackmagic And The “Blue Pill” ==</b>                                        ||
||                                                                                 ||
||     In the spirit of “Hacking” and keeping things cheap I chose to use a        ||
||     $2 STM32 “Blue Pill” with the Blackmagic Probe firmware installed as my     ||
||     debugging preferential. Blackmagic Probe is capable of debugging not only   ||
||     SWD but Serial communication as well. Bad news though, the official         ||
||     hardware platform for Blackmagic normally goes for ~$70-80 which is a lot   ||
||     of money TBH... However, open source being open source you can use the      ||
||     same firmware for other hardware platforms at a cheaper price such as the   ||
||     Blue Pill! I will not be going over the steps in building your own Blue     ||
||     Pill however I would recommend following this guide linked bellow...        ||
||                                                                                 ||

||     Before we can dump the firmware on this chip we first need a way to         ||
||     connect to it. Sometimes hardware devs will leave JTAG/SWD ports in place   ||
||     on the PCB when it’s pushed to production. If you see ports that appear to  ||
||     trace back to the IC pull out the good ole multimeter and a copy of the     ||
||     pinout for the target IC and see where the traces go! If there’s no         ||
||     JTAG/SWD ports on the board don’t fret! We can still solder wires directly  ||
||     to the pins on the chip! It’s not as hard as it sounds however it’s a lot   ||
||     easier with the right tools. I recommend having the following materials…    ||
||                                                                                 ||
||          -> Free floating microscope                                            ||
||          -> Polyimide tape                                                      ||
||          -> 38 AWG Enameled Copper Wire                                         ||
||          -> 63-37 tin lead rosin core solder solder                             ||
||          -> Liquid Flux                                                         ||
||          -> A good adjustable soldering iron with a chisel tip                  ||
||                                                                                 ||
||     *Note: If you never tapped an IC before I would recommend looking this      ||
||     up on youtube but just in case you where wondering, this is how I did it.   ||
||                                                                                 ||
||          -> First orientate the chip with the pinout diagram and find the       ||
||             pins that needed to be tapped. Below is a diagram of the nRF51822   ||
||             and the pins you’ll need to tap.                                    ||
||          -> Adjust your microscope to your work space so you can see what       ||
||             you’re soldering on.                                                ||
||          -> Heat your soldering iron to about 280C.                             ||
||          -> Pre-tin the end of the 38 AWG Enameled wire with a heated glob      ||
||             of solder from your iron.                                           ||
||          -> The heat from the solder will melt the Enamel and the tip of the    ||
||             wire will become silver from the solder.                            ||
||          -> Tape the wire down so the end is close to the target pin on the     ||
||             IC.                                                                 ||
||          -> Clean the tip of your soldering iron then get it “wet” with         ||
||             just a little bit of solder.                                        ||
||          -> Apply a drop of Liquid Flux on the soldering site.                  ||
||          -> Hold down the wire with your thumb and lightly “Kiss” the wire      ||
||             so it welds to the pin on the IC.                                   ||
||          -> Check the weld by poking at it with a pare of tweezers and if it    ||
||             sticks you’re done!                                                 ||

||     If you bridge a pin with a glob of solder you can fix it by brushing the    ||
||     pins with the hot tip of a soldering iron. If you take too much solder      ||
||     away from the pins of the IC you can wet the iron tip and rake it over      ||
||     the pins being careful not to bridge them. Also solder wick comes in handy  ||
||     if there’s a lot of solder but 9 times out of 10 you can fix a problem      ||
||     with just the iron. I would also recommend attaching each wire to a         ||
||     breakout board and add pin headers it so you can interface it better.       ||
||     Also, always check out work with a multimeter to make sure everything       ||
||     stayed in place after you package your target. The photos below shows       ||
||     my work environment and the breakout I created after tapping the IC.        ||

||     I hope you didn’t burn your thumb (too badly >_<) because here comes the    ||
||     easy apart. First connect the nRF51822 with the Blue Pill with the          ||
||     corresponding pins listed below. I would recommend having the target        ||
||     device powered down for this and ONLY power the chip directly from the      ||
||     Blue Pill via the VDD and VSS. If that’s not an option be sure sure the     ||
||     Blue Pill’s ground is connected to the target or SWD won’t work.            ||
||                                                                                 ||

||     Below are the commands I used to connect to the nRF51822 through gdb with   ||
||     the Blue Pill. Be sure you have <b>gdb-arm-none-eabi</b> installed or gdb          ||
||     won't be able to read ARM assembly.                                         ||
||                                                                                 ||

||     The flag for the Code Readout Protection (CRP) is stored within the         ||
||     RBPCONF at 0x10001004. I got this value from the white paper listed above   ||
||     however a quick google search for “Nordic CPR Address” got me <a href=”https:devzone.nordicsemi.com/f/nordic-q-a/27637/how-to-know-if-nrf51-is-protected-from-readback-or-not” target="_blank">this.</a>         ||

||     "Alright hotshot so how do we bypass the CRP if it's enabled?"              ||

||     I'm glad you asked! :D                                                      ||
||                                                                                 ||
||     So first off, When the CRP is enabled it prevents the debugger from         ||
||     accessing parts of the flash. For the nRF51822 when ever you try to read    ||
||     something protected it returns 0x00000000 however when the code is ran it   ||
||     access the flash as needed so you’re still able to view the contents of     ||
||     the flash. The PC register 0x12b9a has a call that loads memory from an     ||
||     address to the r3 register. By editing the r3 register to an address in     ||
||     flash, you can pull the contents of the firmware from this instruction and  ||
||     read it through the debugger! Kinda like that classic BoF CTF where you get ||
||     the program to read the protected text file with a little bit of magic! :D  ||
||                                                                                 ||
||     The White paper above provided a ruby script that will scrape the registers ||
||     and will build copy of the firmware by stepping through the code in gdb.    ||
||     However this was built for OpenOCD so the POC dose not directly apply for   ||
||     the Blackmagic Probe. Bellow is the white paper I’ve found and a nice write ||
||     up with a Python version of the POC from Cybergibbons.                      ||
||                                                                                 ||

||     The TL;DR because this step wasn’t necessary for my target but I feel it’s  ||
||     important to talk about this? Let's play around with bypassing the CRP in   ||
||     gdb. :3                                                                     ||

||     I copied over the bin from the Chemion LED glasses and flashed it on to an  ||
||     extra nRF5188 to see if we could play around with the CRP. Below are the    ||

||     Ahh Nuts! Looks like we can’t change the firmware through gdb and I don't   ||
||     have a debugger that can run OpenOCD... This might have to wait for a bit.  ||
||     Failure happends and it was worth a try but no luck this time. GDB has      ||
||     a python API that looks like a valid option to port the available POC. It   ||
||     would be neet to see more suport for that POC besides OpenOCD...            ||
||     SO! TL;DR, I'll come back to this latter. ;)                                ||
